                <p>I am a frontend developer focused on building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces using modern technologies like React and CSS. I enjoy turning ideas and designs into structured, functional layouts while paying close attention to spacing, responsiveness, and usability.</p>
                <p>I am currently strengthening my skills by building real-world projects that involve navigation systems, dashboards, authentication flows, and interactive UI components. My approach to development is centered on understanding how things work under the hood rather than just copying solutions, which helps me write more maintainable and scalable code.</p>
                <p>My long-term goal is to grow into a well-rounded full-stack developer with a strong foundation in both frontend and backend systems. I am always learning, refining my workflow, and challenging myself with more complex problems to improve my craft.</p>
